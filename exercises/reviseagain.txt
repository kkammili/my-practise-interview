array operations

rest and spread example
function sum(...args) {
    console.log(args)
    // return x + y + z;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(sum(...numbers));
// Expected output: 6

circular list, comparing objects with reference

fromLast for loop why n + 1 ?

qfroms solution

why DFS does working with es5 for loop and works only with es6

Note for pop() and push():

pop() has a shorter name than push().
pop() removes the last array item.
push() appends items to the array.
Similarly, shift() vs unshift():

shift() has a shorter name than unshift().
shift() removes the first array item.
unshift() prepends items to the array.

bst validate definately should revise
