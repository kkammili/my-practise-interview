# Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

## Examples

### Example 1:

- **Input:** word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
- **Output:** "apbqcr"
- **Explanation:** The merged string will be merged as so:


### Example 2:

- **Input:** word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
- **Output:** "apbqrs"
- **Explanation:** Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.


### Example 3:

- **Input:** word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
- **Output:** "apbqcd"
- **Explanation:** Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.


## Constraints

- 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
- word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution in JavaScript

```javascript
var mergeAlternately = function(word1, word2) {
  word1 = word1.split('')
  word2 = word2.split('')
  let res = []

  while(word1.length || word2.length){
      let v1 = word1.length && word1.shift()
      let v2 = word2.length && word2.shift()
      if(v1){
          res.push(v1)
      }
      if(v2){
          res.push(v2)
      }
  }
  return res.join('')
}
```
## Steps to Merge Strings Alternately

To understand how to merge two strings alternately, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Result String**: Start with an empty string or an empty array that will hold the final merged string. This is where you'll accumulate the alternated characters from both strings.

2. **Convert Strings to Arrays (Optional)**: Optionally, you can convert both strings into arrays. This can make it easier to manipulate individual characters by enabling the use of array methods like `shift`, which removes the first element from an array.

3. **Alternate Between Strings**: Use a loop to alternate adding characters from each string (or array) to the result string. This is the core logic for merging the strings.

4. **Check for Remaining Characters**: After the main loop, if one string is longer than the other, it will still have characters left. Append these remaining characters to the result string.

5. **Return the Merged String**: Convert the result back into a string if you used an array to accumulate characters. Return this merged string as the final output.
