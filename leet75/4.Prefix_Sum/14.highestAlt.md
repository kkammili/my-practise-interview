# 1732. Find the Highest Altitude

## Problem Statement

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip at point 0 with an altitude of 0.

You are given an integer array `gain` of length n, where `gain[i]` is the net gain in altitude between points `i` and `i + 1` for all `(0 <= i < n)`. Return the highest altitude reached during the trip.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest altitude reached is 1.


**Example 2:**
Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest altitude reached is 0.


### Constraints

- `n == gain.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `-100 <= gain[i] <= 100`

## JavaScript Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} gain
 * @return {number}
 */
var largestAltitude = function(gain) {
    let acc = 0;  // Accumulator for altitude sum, starts at 0 as initial altitude

    // Calculate the altitude at each point and store in an array
    const alt = gain.map(itm => {
        acc = acc + itm;  // Increment the accumulator by the current gain
        return acc;       // Return the updated altitude
    });

    // Find the maximum altitude from the array
    const maxAlt = Math.max(...alt, 0);  // Include 0 to compare against the initial altitude

    return maxAlt;  // Return the maximum altitude found
};
```
### Comments on the Solution
Line 3: Initialize acc to zero, representing the starting altitude.
Line 6-10: Map over the gain array, updating acc with each element to compute the altitude after each gain.
Line 13: Use Math.max to find the highest altitude reached, considering the initial altitude (0) as well.

### Notes to Remember
The solution tracks cumulative altitude gains using an accumulator.
The use of Math.max(...alt, 0) ensures the highest point is compared with the starting point, handling cases where all altitude changes might be negative.
This approach directly relates to prefix sums, where you compute running totals and then derive results from these totals.
