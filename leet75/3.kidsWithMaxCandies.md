# 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

Given an integer array `candies`, where `candies[i]` represents the number of candies the i-th kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, denoting the number of extra candies that you have. You need to return a boolean array `result` of length `n`, where `result[i]` is true if, after giving the i-th kid all the `extraCandies`, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise. Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

## Examples

1. **Input**: `candies = [2,3,5,1,3]`, `extraCandies = 3`  
   **Output**: `[true,true,true,false,true]`  
   **Explanation**: By giving all extra candies to:
   - Kid 1, they will have 5 candies, which ties for the greatest number of candies.
   - Kid 2, they will have 6 candies, the greatest number of candies.
   - Kid 3, they will have 8 candies, the greatest number of candies.
   - Kid 4, they will have 4 candies, not the greatest number of candies.
   - Kid 5, they will have 6 candies, the greatest number of candies.

2. **Input**: `candies = [4,2,1,1,2]`, `extraCandies = 1`  
   **Output**: `[true,false,false,false,false]`  
   **Explanation**: Only Kid 1 will have the greatest number of candies, regardless of who receives the extra candy.

3. **Input**: `candies = [12,1,12]`, `extraCandies = 10`  
   **Output**: `[true,false,true]`  
   **Explanation**: Kids 1 and 3 can both have the greatest number of candies by receiving the extra candies.

## Solution in JavaScript

```javascript
var kidsWithCandies = function(candies, extraCandies) {
   // we can use arr.reduce method to compute maxcandies
    const maxCandies = Math.max(...candies);
    return candies.map(candy => candy + extraCandies >= maxCandies);
};
```

## Explanation

The problem is solved in the following steps:
1. **Find the Current Maximum**: First, we find out the maximum number of candies any kid currently has using the `Math.max()` function.
2. **Determine Possibilities**: Then, for each kid, we check if adding the `extraCandies` to their current count would make their total equal to or greater than the current maximum. This is done using the `map()` function which transforms the original `candies` array into a new array of boolean values.
3. **Return the Result**: The result is a new array indicating whether each kid can have the greatest number of candies by receiving the `extraCandies`.

This approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging JavaScript's array methods for concise and readable code.
