# Problem 2130: Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List

## Description

Given the head of a linked list with an even length, calculate the maximum sum of values between nodes and their corresponding "twins". Twins are defined such that for a node at index `i`, its twin is at index `n-1-i`, where `n` is the length of the linked list.

## Examples

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `head = [5,4,2,1]`
- **Output:** `6`
- **Explanation:** Twin sums are all 6 (5+1 and 4+2).

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `head = [4,2,2,3]`
- **Output:** `7`
- **Explanation:** Twin sums are 7 (4+3) and 4 (2+2), max is 7.

### Example 3:
- **Input:** `head = [1,100000]`
- **Output:** `100001`
- **Explanation:** Only one pair (1+100000), sum is 100001.

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is an even integer in the range [2, 100,000].
- Node values are between 1 and 100,000.

## JavaScript Solution

```javascript
function maximumTwinSum(head) {
    let fast = head, slow = head;
    let stack = [];

    // Traverse with two pointers to find the midpoint
    while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
        stack.push(slow.val);
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }

    let maxSum = 0;

    // Calculate the twin sums from the midpoint onwards
    while (slow !== null) {
        let currentSum = slow.val + stack.pop();
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
        slow = slow.next;
    }

    return maxSum;
}
```
### Explanation of the Code
Function ListNode: Node constructor for a singly linked list.
Function maximumTwinSum: Calculates the maximum twin sum in a linked list.
While Loop: Uses two pointers to reach the middle of the list, saving first half values in a stack.
Second While Loop: Compares values from the stack with second-half nodes to find maximum twin sum.
Notes
Space Complexity: O(n/2) due to stack usage.
Time Complexity: O(n) for traversing the list.
