# Problem 206: Reverse Linked List

## Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the head of the reversed list.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
- **Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`
- **Output:** `[5,4,3,2,1]`

#### Example 2:
- **Input:** `head = [1,2]`
- **Output:** `[2,1]`

#### Example 3:
- **Input:** `head = []`
- **Output:** `[]`

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list ranges from 0 to 5000.
- Node values range from -5000 to 5000.

## Solutions

### JavaScript Solution (Iterative)

```javascript
function reverseList(head) {
    let prev = null; // Start with no node preceding the head
    let current = head; // Start from the head
    let next = null; // Will be used to temporarily store the next node

    while (current !== null) {
        next = current.next; // Store next node
        current.next = prev; // Reverse current node's pointer
        prev = current; // Move prev up to current
        current = next; // Proceed to the next node
    }
    return prev; // New head of the list
}

// recursive approach
function reverseListRecursive(head, prev = null) {
    if (head === null) return prev; // If end of list, return new head
    let next = head.next; // Next node to process
    head.next = prev; // Reverse current node's pointer
    return reverseListRecursive(next, head); // Recurse with next node and current as new prev
}
```
### Comments Explained:
Initialize pointers: prev, current, and next help traverse and modify the list.
Traverse and modify: Loop through each node and adjust links to reverse the list.
Return new head: After finishing the traversal, prev becomes the new head.

### Notes
Iterative vs Recursive: Understand both approaches for reversing a linked list.
Stack Overflow: Be aware of stack overflow in recursive calls for very long lists.
Edge Cases: Handle empty lists properly to avoid errors.
