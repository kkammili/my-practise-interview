# 2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List

## Problem Statement
You are given the head of a linked list. Your task is to delete the middle node of the list and return the head of the modified linked list. The middle node of a linked list with size `n` is defined as the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start, using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to `x`.

### Examples

1. **Input:** `head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]`  
   **Output:** `[1,3,4,1,2,6]`  
   **Explanation:** The list has 7 elements, so the middle node is the 3rd index (value 7). Removing it results in `[1,3,4,1,2,6]`.

2. **Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4]`  
   **Output:** `[1,2,4]`  
   **Explanation:** For a list with 4 elements, the middle node is the 2nd index (value 3). The list after removal is `[1,2,4]`.

3. **Input:** `head = [2,1]`  
   **Output:** `[2]`  
   **Explanation:** With 2 elements, the middle node is the 1st index (value 1). The list then contains just the node with value 2.

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 105

## JavaScript Solution

```javascript
function deleteMiddle(head) {
    if (!head || !head.next) {
        // If the list is empty or has only one node, return null
        return null;
    }

    let slow = head; // Slow pointer starts at the head
    let fast = head; // Fast pointer also starts at the head
    let prev = null; // This will keep track of the node before the slow pointer

    // Move the fast pointer twice as fast as the slow pointer
    while (fast && fast.next) {
        prev = slow; // Update prev to the current slow
        slow = slow.next; // Move slow to the next node
        fast = fast.next.next; // Move fast two nodes at a time
    }

    // Skip the middle node pointed by slow
    if (prev) {
        prev.next = slow.next;
    }

    return head;
}
```
### Notes to Remember
Ensure that you handle edge cases where the list is extremely short (one or no nodes).
The two-pointer approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a few pointers and traverses the list once.
This solution can be easily tested on platforms like LeetCode by passing in various linked list configurations to check if the middle node is correctly removed.
