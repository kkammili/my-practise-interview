# Problem 328: Odd Even Linked List

## Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list. The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

Note:
- The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
- You must solve the problem in **O(1) extra space complexity** and **O(n) time complexity**.

### Examples

#### Example 1:

**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
**Output:** `[1,3,5,2,4]`

#### Example 2:

**Input:** `head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]`  
**Output:** `[2,3,6,7,1,5,4]`

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range `[0, 10,000]`.
- Node values range from `-1,000,000` to `1,000,000`.

## JavaScript Solution

```javascript
function oddEvenList(head) {
    if (!head || !head.next) {
        return head;
    }

    let odd = head; // Start of odd indexed nodes
    let even = head.next; // Start of even indexed nodes
    let evenHead = even; // Head of the even list to be appended later

    while (even && even.next) {
        odd.next = even.next; // Link current odd to next odd
        odd = odd.next; // Move odd pointer
        even.next = odd.next; // Link current even to next even
        even = even.next; // Move even pointer
    }

    odd.next = evenHead; // Append even list after odd list ends
    return head;
}
```
### Comments Explained:
Handle base cases: Check if the list is empty or has only one element.
Initialize pointers: Set up pointers for odd and even indexed nodes.
Traversal and re-linking: Iterate through the list to separate and then reconnect the nodes based on odd and even indices.
Final connection: Append the even nodes list to the end of the odd nodes list.

### Notes:
Ensure there are no edge cases left unhandled, like a single element or an empty list.
Check that all nodes are linked correctly to avoid potential issues like cycles or broken links.
Test the solution thoroughly to make sure it works for all edge cases.
