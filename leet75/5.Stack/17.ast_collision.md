# Asteroid Collision

## Problem Description

We are given an array `asteroids` of integers where each integer represents an asteroid in a row. The absolute value of each integer represents the size of the asteroid, and the sign represents the direction of the asteroid's movement (positive values mean the asteroid is moving to the right, and negative values mean it is moving to the left). All asteroids move at the same speed.

Determine the state of the asteroids after all collisions have been resolved. When two asteroids collide, the smaller one will explode and disappear; if they are the same size, both will explode. Asteroids moving in the same direction will not collide.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `asteroids = [5, 10, -5]`  
**Output:** `[5, 10]`  
**Explanation:** The asteroids 10 and -5 collide, resulting in the -5 exploding. The 5 and 10, moving in the same direction, never collide.

### Example 2

**Input:** `asteroids = [8, -8]`  
**Output:** `[]`  
**Explanation:** The 8 and -8 collide and are the same size, hence both explode.

### Example 3

**Input:** `asteroids = [10, 2, -5]`  
**Output:** `[10]`  
**Explanation:** The 2 and -5 collide, the -5 having a larger absolute size survives and then collides with the 10, but as 10 is larger, only the 10 survives.

## Constraints

- `2 <= asteroids.length <= 104`
- `-1000 <= asteroids[i] <= 1000`
- `asteroids[i] != 0`

## JavaScript Solution

```javascript
function asteroidCollision(asteroids) {
    const stack = [];
    for (let ast of asteroids) {
        let explode = false;
        while (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] > 0 && ast < 0) {
            if (-ast > stack[stack.length - 1]) {
                stack.pop();
                continue;
            } else if (-ast === stack[stack.length - 1]) {
                stack.pop();
            }
            explode = true;
            break;
        }
        if (!explode) {
            stack.push(ast);
        }
    }
    return stack;
}
```
### Explanation
Stack Implementation: The stack helps keep track of asteroids that have not yet been destroyed. It stores asteroids in the order they are encountered, and collisions are handled as new asteroids are encountered and compared against the top of the stack.
Collision Logic: If the current asteroid is moving left (ast < 0) and the last asteroid in the stack is moving right (stack[stack.length - 1] > 0), a collision occurs. Depending on their sizes, either the current, the last, or both asteroids are removed from the stack.
### Notes to Remember
Right-going Safe: Once a right-going asteroid is pushed onto the stack, it's guaranteed safe until a left-going asteroid is encountered.
Efficiency: The solution is efficient as each asteroid is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
Edge Cases: Consider edge cases like all asteroids moving in one direction, or alternating large and small asteroids to ensure robustness.
