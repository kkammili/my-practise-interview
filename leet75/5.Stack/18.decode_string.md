# Problem: 394. Decode String

## Problem Statement
Given an encoded string, return its decoded string. The encoding rule is `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times. Note that `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

The input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, it is assumed that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, `k`. For example, there will not be input like `3a` or `2[4]`.

The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed 10^5.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
**Input:** `s = "3[a]2[bc]"`
**Output:** `"aaabcbc"`

#### Example 2:
**Input:** `s = "3[a2[c]]"`
**Output:** `"accaccacc"`

#### Example 3:
**Input:** `s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"`
**Output:** `"abcabccdcdcdef"`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 30`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets `[]`.
- `s` is guaranteed to be a valid input.
- All the integers in `s` are in the range [1, 300].

## JavaScript Solution

```javascript
function decodeString(s) {
    let stack = [];
    let currentNum = 0;
    let currentString = "";

    for (const char of s) {
        if (char >= '0' && char <= '9') {
            currentNum = currentNum * 10 + parseInt(char);
        } else if (char === '[') {
            // Push the current number and string onto the stack
            stack.push([currentString, currentNum]);
            // Reset for the next encoded string
            currentString = "";
            currentNum = 0;
        } else if (char === ']') {
            // Pop from the stack to get the last recorded string and repetition
            let [lastString, repeatTimes] = stack.pop();
            currentString = lastString + currentString.repeat(repeatTimes);
        } else {
            currentString += char;
        }
    }
    return currentString;
}
```

### Explanation:
We utilize a stack to manage chunks of numbers and strings as we parse through the input.
Digits are converted into numbers to determine how many times an upcoming string should be repeated.
When a [ is encountered, the current number and accumulated string are pushed onto the stack and reset.
At each ], we pop from the stack to retrieve and repeat the string inside the brackets, concatenating it to the part before the brackets.
Finally, the built string is constructed as we exit the loops.

### Notes to Remember
Using a stack is key in problems where nested or recursive structures need to be handled, such as nested encoded strings.
Understanding the problem's constraints helps in optimizing the solution, especially knowing that the input is valid and well-formed.
This solution handles nested and consecutive encoded strings efficiently and clearly demonstrates using stacks for parsing problems.
