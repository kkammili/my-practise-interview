# Problem 2390: Removing Stars From a String

## Description

You are given a string `s` that includes lowercase English letters and stars `*`. Your task is to process the string by performing a series of operations. In each operation, you choose a star in `s`, remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as the star itself. Continue this process until all stars have been removed and return the resulting string.

**Note:**
- The input guarantees that the operation is always possible.
- The resulting string will always be unique.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `s = "leet**cod*e"`

**Output:** `lecoe`

**Explanation:**
Perform the operations from left to right:
- The closest character to the first star is 't', resulting in "lee*cod*e".
- The closest character to the next star is 'e', resulting in "lecod*e".
- The closest character to the last star is 'd', resulting in "lecoe".
No more stars are left, so "lecoe" is the final string.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `s = "erase*****"`

**Output:** `""`

**Explanation:**
Each operation removes the last non-star character until all characters are removed, resulting in an empty string.

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters and stars `*`.

## JavaScript Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var removeStars = function(s) {
    let rem = []

    for(let char of s){
        if(char !== '*'){
            rem.push(char)
        }else{
            rem.pop()
        }
    }

    return rem.join("")
    
};
```
### Explanation
Stack Usage: The stack is ideal for this problem because it allows us to handle the nearest-neighbor interactions efficiently. When a star is encountered, it removes the most recent character added to the stack.
Efficient String Building: Using a stack and then joining it to form the final string is much more efficient in JavaScript due to the immutability of strings.

### Notes to Remember
Optimization: The use of a stack is both time-efficient and intuitive for this kind of problem where elements need to be removed in response to subsequent symbols.
Edge Cases: It's important to handle strings with contiguous stars and no preceding characters correctly, even though the problem guarantees valid input.
Testing: Always test edge cases like an empty resulting string or a string where no stars are removed.
