# Question: 1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, find the largest string `x` such that `x` divides both `str1` and `str2`. A string `x` divides a string `y` if `y` can be constructed by repeating `x` multiple times.

## Examples

1. **Input**: `str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"`  
   **Output**: `"ABC"`

2. **Input**: `str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"`  
   **Output**: `"AB"`

3. **Input**: `str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"`  
   **Output**: `""` (No common divisor)

## Constraints

- `1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000`
- `str1` and `str2` consist of English uppercase letters.

---

## JavaScript Solution

```javascript
function gcdOfStrings(str1, str2) {
    function gcd(a, b) {
        while (b !== 0) {
            let temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }

    if (str1 + str2 !== str2 + str1) {
        return "";
    }

    let gcdLength = gcd(str1.length, str2.length);

    return str1.substring(0, gcdLength);
}
```

## Explanation in Simple Terms

1. **Compatibility Check**: We first ensure that by mixing the sequences from both strings, you don't create something that looks different. If they can't be mixed and matched, no common word exists.
2. **Find the Common Structure**: We look for the longest sequence that fits both strings. This is determined by finding the greatest common divisor of the lengths of the two strings.
3. **Extract the Common Sequence**: Once the size of the common structure is determined, we take that part from the beginning of one of the strings. This part is your common divisor.
