# Problem 11: Container With Most Water

## Description
Given an integer array `height` representing the heights of lines on a graph, find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store. Note that the container must be formed between two lines, so the sides are vertical, and the container cannot be slanted.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
- **Output:** 49
- **Explanation:** The maximum area of water (blue section) that the container can contain is 49, using the second and the last vertical lines.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** height = [1,1]
- **Output:** 1
- **Explanation:** The lines form a container that can store a water area of 1.

### Constraints
- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution in JavaScript

```javascript
function maxArea(height) {
    let maxWater = 0;
    let left = 0;
    let right = height.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        const width = right - left;
        const currentWater = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * width;
        maxWater = Math.max(maxWater, currentWater);

        if (height[left] < height[right]) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }

    return maxWater;
}
```
### Comments
Two Pointer Technique: This approach uses two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the array. The idea is to calculate the area between these two pointers and then move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward. This ensures that every potentially larger area is checked.
Optimization Logic: By moving the pointer from the shorter line, we are attempting to find a taller line that might increase the area, as the width of the area reduces with each step inward.
### Notes
Performance: This method is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in height.
Edge Cases: Make sure to handle arrays where all elements are the same or where elements are in increasing or decreasing order.
