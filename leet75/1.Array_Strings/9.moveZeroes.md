# Problem 283: Move Zeroes

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, move all the zeros to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The operation must be done in-place without making a copy of the array.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** `nums = [0,1,0,3,12]`
- **Output:** `[1,3,12,0,0]`

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** `nums = [0]`
- **Output:** `[0]`

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`

## Solution in JavaScript

```javascript
/**
 * Moves all zeros in the array to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.
 * @param {number[]} nums - The input array of numbers.
 */
function moveZeroes(nums) {
    let lastNonZeroFoundAt = 0;  // Tracks the last non-zero index found.

    // Iterate over the array to find non-zero elements.
    for (let current = 0; current < nums.length; current++) {
         if (nums[current] !== 0) {
            // Swap the current element with the element at lastNonZeroFoundAt.
            var temp = nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt];  // Store the value at lastNonZeroFoundAt in a temporary variable
            nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt] = nums[current];  // Move the non-zero element to the position of the last non-zero found
            nums[current] = temp;  // Move the original value at lastNonZeroFoundAt (typically a zero) to the current position

            // Move the lastNonZeroFoundAt index forward.
            lastNonZeroFoundAt++;
        }
    }
}
```
### Comments for Solution
lastNonZeroFoundAt is used to keep track of where the next non-zero element should be placed.
We iterate over the array with current. If the current element is not zero, we swap it with the element at lastNonZeroFoundAt and then increment lastNonZeroFoundAt.
This effectively moves all zeros to the end of the array while preserving the order of non-zero elements.
### Notes to Remember
The two-pointer technique is efficient for solving problems where elements need to be partitioned into two parts based on a condition.
Always consider edge cases, such as arrays containing only zeros or no zeros at all, to ensure the solution is robust.
This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it suitable for large inputs as specified by the constraints.
