# Problem 238: Product of Array Except Self

## Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` where each `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`. The algorithm should run in O(n) time without using the division operation. The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

### Examples

1. **Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4]`  
   **Output:** `[24,12,8,6]`  
   **Explanation:** For the first element, the product of `[2,3,4]` is 24. For the second element, the product of `[1,3,4]` is 12, and so on.

2. **Input:** `nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]`  
   **Output:** `[0,0,9,0,0]`  
   **Explanation:** Any product that includes the `0` becomes 0.

### Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Solution in JavaScript

```javascript
var productExceptSelf = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let answer = new Array(n).fill(1);

    let left = 1;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        answer[i] = left;
        left *= nums[i];
    }

    let right = 1;
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        answer[i] *= right;
        right *= nums[i];
    }

    return answer;
};
```

#### Explanation
Two-Pass Solution: The solution utilizes two passes through the array to construct the output:
First Pass (Left to Right): Calculates the product of all elements to the left of each index and stores it in the answer array.
Second Pass (Right to Left): Multiplies each element in the answer array by the product of all elements to the right of the index.
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n) due to the additional array used to store the results. No extra space other than the result array is used, aligning with the constraints.

### Comments
The algorithm avoids the division operation entirely by using two loops to handle the products before and after each index.
Initial pass sets up the base product from the left, and the reverse pass adjusts each element by multiplying it with the right product.
Notes
Edge Cases: The function handles zeros and negative numbers correctly as per the provided examples.
Optimization: This approach ensures that each element is visited only twice, making it very efficient with a time complexity of O(n).
Testing: To test this solution, consider edge cases with multiple zeros, all negative numbers, and maximum array length.
