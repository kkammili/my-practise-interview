Look at JS Maps, sets totally
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set

Converting JS Map/Set to Array
const map = new Map([
  [1, 'one'],
  [2, 'two'],
  [3, 'three']
]);
const keyValueArray = Array.from(map);
// or using spread operator
const keyValueArray2 = [...map];

wanted keys to be an array ?
const keysArray = Array.from(map.keys())
// or using spread operator
const keysArray2 = [...map.keys()]

// stack ast collision took me a day
