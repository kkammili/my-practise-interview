# Problem: Can Place Flowers

## Description

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and others are not. Flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots due to their spreading roots. Given an integer array `flowerbed` representing the garden (where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty), and an integer `n`, return `true` if it is possible to plant `n` new flowers in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule, and `false` otherwise.

### Examples

1. **Input:** `flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1`  
   **Output:** `true`  
   **Explanation:** There is one place to plant one flower (between the two existing plants).

2. **Input:** `flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2`  
   **Output:** `false`  
   **Explanation:** There isn't enough space to plant two flowers without violating the no-adjacent rule.

### Constraints

- `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `flowerbed[i]` is 0 or 1.
- There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
- `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`

## Solution in JavaScript

```javascript
function canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed, n) {
    let emptySpaces = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
        if (!flowerbed[i-1] && flowerbed[i] === 0 && !flowerbed[i+1]) {
            flowerbed[i] = 1;
            emptySpaces += 1;
        }
    }
    return n <= emptySpaces;
}
```

### Explanation
This solution iterates through the flowerbed array to count potential places to plant a flower. A flower can be planted if:

The current plot is empty (flowerbed[i] === 0).
Both adjacent plots (if they exist) are also empty. This is checked with !flowerbed[i-1] and !flowerbed[i+1].
Each time a flower is planted, the function marks the plot as taken by setting flowerbed[i] = 1 and increments the count of emptySpaces. After the loop, the function checks if the count of emptySpaces is at least n, which determines the return value.

### Notes
Edge Handling: The solution carefully checks adjacent plots, including handling edge cases where i is at the beginning or end of the array.
In-Place Array Modification: The flowerbed array is modified in place, which helps in maintaining space efficiency but means the original input is altered.
Complexity: The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the flowerbed array. The space complexity is O(1) apart from the input array.
