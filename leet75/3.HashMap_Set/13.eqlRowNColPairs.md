# 2352. Equal Row and Column Pairs

## Problem Statement

Given a 0-indexed n x n integer matrix `grid`, return the number of pairs `(ri, cj)` such that row `ri` and column `cj` are equal. A row and column pair is considered equal if they contain the same elements in the same order (i.e., an equal array).

### Examples

**Example 1:**
Input: grid = [[3,2,1],[1,7,6],[2,7,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is 1 equal row and column pair:

(Row 2, Column 1): [2,7,7]


**Example 2:**
Input: grid = [[3,1,2,2],[1,4,4,5],[2,4,2,2],[2,4,2,2]]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 equal row and column pairs:

(Row 0, Column 0): [3,1,2,2]
(Row 2, Column 2): [2,4,2,2]
(Row 3, Column 2): [2,4,2,2]


### Constraints

- `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 200`
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 105`

## JavaScript Solution

```javascript
function equalPairs(grid) {
    const n = grid.length;
    let count = 0;

    // Transpose the grid to easily compare columns with rows
    const transposed = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            transposed[j][i] = grid[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Compare each row with each column (now also represented as rows in transposed)
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (arrayEquals(grid[i], transposed[j])) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Helper function to check if two arrays are equal
function arrayEquals(a, b) {
    if (a.length !== b.length) return false;
    for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        if (a[i] !== b[i]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
### Comments on the Solution
Line 3: Determine the size of the grid n.
Line 4: Initialize the counter for tracking the number of equal row and column pairs.
Lines 7-11: Transpose the matrix grid to facilitate column and row comparison.
Lines 14-20: Double loop to compare each row with each transposed row (original column).
Line 15-17: Utilize a helper function arrayEquals to compare the row and the transposed row for equality.

### Notes to Remember
Transposing the grid simplifies the comparison process as it allows us to treat column comparison like row comparison.
A helper function for array comparison is crucial due to JavaScript's lack of built-in deep comparison for arrays.
The time complexity is O(n^3) due to the triple nested loop structure, which can be acceptable given the constraints.
