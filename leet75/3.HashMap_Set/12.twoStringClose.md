# 1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close

## Problem Statement

Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

1. **Swap any two existing characters:** For example, `abcde -> aecdb`.
2. **Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character:** For example, `aacabb -> bbcbaa` (all `a`'s turn into `b`'s, and all `b`'s turn into `a`'s).

You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary. Given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, return `true` if `word1` and `word2` are close, and `false` otherwise.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "abc" -> "acb"
Apply Operation 1: "acb" -> "bca"

**Example 2:**
Input: word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any number of operations.

**Example 3:**
Input: word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 3 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "cabbba" -> "caabbb"
Apply Operation 2: "caabbb" -> "baaccc"
Apply Operation 2: "baaccc" -> "abbccc"


### Constraints

- 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 105
- word1 and word2 contain only lowercase English letters.

## JavaScript Solution

```javascript
function closeStrings(word1, word2) {
    if (word1.length !== word2.length) return false;  // Quick check on lengths

    const count1 = {}, count2 = {};  // To hold frequency counts of characters

    // Fill the frequency count objects
    for (const char of word1) count1[char] = (count1[char] || 0) + 1;
    for (const char of word2) count2[char] = (count2[char] || 0) + 1;

    // Check for same characters in both strings
    if (Object.keys(count1).sort().join('') !== Object.keys(count2).sort().join('')) return false;

    // Extract frequency values and sort them
    const values1 = Object.values(count1).sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const values2 = Object.values(count2).sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Check if the sorted frequency arrays match
    return values1.join('') === values2.join('');
}
```

### Comments on the Solution
Lines 2-3: Check if the strings have the same length. If not, they can't be close.
Lines 5-6: Create objects to keep track of how many times each character appears in both strings.
Lines 9-10: Populate these objects with the character counts from word1 and word2.
Line 13: Check if the characters themselves are the same in both strings (ignore frequency for now).
Lines 16-17: Get the frequencies of characters in both strings, sort them, and check if they match.

### Notes to Remember
Checking for the same characters and the same frequency distributions (sorted) ensures that the two strings can be transformed into each other using the described operations.
Sorting the characters and their frequencies simplifies the comparison, turning it into a straightforward equality check.
The algorithm mainly depends on character frequency and character set matching, regardless of their order in the string.
