# 1207. Unique Number of Occurrences

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, return `true` if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique or `false` otherwise.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

**Example 2:**
Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false

**Example 3:**
Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true


### Constraints
- 1 <= arr.length <= 1000
- -1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000

## JavaScript Solution

```javascript
// Function to determine if each value's occurrence count in an array is unique
var uniqueOccurrences = function(arr) {
    // Create a Map to store each number's occurrence count
    const hmap = new Map();
    
    // Loop over each number in the input array
    arr.forEach(num => {
        // If the number is already in the map, increment its count
        if(hmap.get(num)) {
            hmap.set(num, hmap.get(num) + 1);
        } else {
            // Otherwise, add the number to the map with an initial count of 1
            hmap.set(num, 1);
        }
    });

    // Extract all the occurrence counts into an array
    const arrNum = Array.from(hmap.values());
    
    // Check if the array length is the same as the size of a Set made from the array
    // This checks for uniqueness of occurrence counts
    return arrNum.length === new Set(arrNum).size;
};
```
### Line-by-Line Explanation
Lines 3-5: Define the function uniqueOccurrences which takes an array arr.
Line 7: Initialize a new Map to count the frequency of each number.
Lines 8-14: Loop through each element, checking if it exists in the map. If it does, increment the count, otherwise add it with a count of 1.
Line 17: Convert the map's values to an array to get all occurrence counts.
Line 19: Convert the array to a Set to eliminate duplicates and check if the set size equals the array length, confirming all frequencies are unique.

### Notes to Remember
Utilizing a Map is efficient for counting elements as it allows for quick lookups, insertions, and updates.
A Set is used to ensure that all frequency counts are unique by comparing the size of the set with the size of the frequency array.
The overall time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, since each element is processed once.
