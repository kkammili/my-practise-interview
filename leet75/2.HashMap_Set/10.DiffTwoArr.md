# Problem 2215: Find the Difference of Two Arrays

## Description
Given two 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return a list `answer` of size 2 where:
- `answer[0]` is a list of all distinct integers in `nums1` which are not present in `nums2`.
- `answer[1]` is a list of all distinct integers in `nums2` which are not present in `nums1`.

Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]
- **Output:** [[1,3],[4,6]]
- **Explanation:**
  - For nums1, 2 is present in nums2, whereas 1 and 3 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[0] = [1,3].
  - For nums2, 2 is present in nums1, whereas 4 and 6 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[1] = [4,6].

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** nums1 = [1,2,3,3], nums2 = [1,1,2,2]
- **Output:** [[3],[]]
- **Explanation:**
  - Every integer in nums1 appears in nums2 except for 3. Since 3 appears twice in nums1 but it's unique, it's only included once in answer[0].
  - Every integer in nums2 is present in nums1, so answer[1] is empty.

### Constraints
- 1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
- -1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000

## Solution in JavaScript

```javascript
function findDifference(nums1, nums2) {
    const set1 = new Set(nums1);
    const set2 = new Set(nums2);

    const diff1 = Array.from(set1).filter(x => !set2.has(x));
    const diff2 = Array.from(set2).filter(x => !set1.has(x));

    return [diff1, diff2];
}
```

### Comments
- **Sets for Uniqueness**: We utilize JavaScript `Set` to handle unique elements from both arrays, eliminating the need to manage duplicates manually.
- **Filter for Difference**: The `filter` method combined with `Set.has()` allows us to efficiently determine which elements of one set are not present in the other, leveraging the average O(1) time complexity of hash set lookups.

### Notes
- **Performance**: This approach efficiently handles the difference between two arrays with a time complexity of O(n + m), where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the two input arrays.
- **Edge Cases**: Make sure to test cases where one array is empty or both arrays are identical, as well as cases where the arrays have no common elements.
