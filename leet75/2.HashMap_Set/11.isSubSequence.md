# Problem 392: Is Subsequence

## Description
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
- **Output:** true
- **Explanation:** "abc" is a subsequence of "ahbgdc".

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
- **Output:** false
- **Explanation:** "axc" is not a subsequence of "ahbgdc".

### Constraints
- 0 <= s.length <= 100
- 0 <= t.length <= 10,000
- Both `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution in JavaScript

```javascript
function isSubsequence(s, t) {
    let sIndex = 0;
    for (let tIndex = 0; tIndex < t.length && sIndex < s.length; tIndex++) {
        if (s[sIndex] === t[tIndex]) {
            sIndex++;
        }
    }
    return sIndex === s.length;
}
```
### Comments
Two Pointer Technique: This solution uses a two-pointer approach, where sIndex and tIndex are used to traverse the strings s and t respectively. This method ensures that we check each character of t and move the pointer on s only when a matching character is found.
Efficiency: The loop runs for the length of t but stops early if all characters of s are found, making it efficient.
### Notes
Performance: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of t. This is because, in the worst case, we might need to check each character in t to determine if s is a subsequence.
Edge Cases: It is important to test cases where s is an empty string (which should always return true) and where t is shorter than s (which should return false).
