# Problem: 933. Number of Recent Calls

## Problem Statement
Implement the `RecentCounter` class to count the number of recent requests within a certain time frame. Specifically, you need to handle a method `ping(t)`, which:
- Adds a new request at time `t`, where `t` represents some time in milliseconds.
- Returns the number of requests that have happened in the past 3000 milliseconds (including the new request), specifically within the inclusive range `[t - 3000, t]`.

It is guaranteed that every call to `ping` uses a strictly larger value of `t` than the previous call.

### Example

```plaintext
Input
["RecentCounter", "ping", "ping", "ping", "ping"]
[[], [1], [100], [3001], [3002]]
Output
[null, 1, 2, 3, 3]

Explanation
RecentCounter recentCounter = new RecentCounter();
recentCounter.ping(1);     // requests = [1], range is [-2999,1], return 1
recentCounter.ping(100);   // requests = [1, 100], range is [-2900,100], return 2
recentCounter.ping(3001);  // requests = [1, 100, 3001], range is [1,3001], return 3
recentCounter.ping(3002);  // requests = [1, 100, 3001, 3002], range is [2,3002], return 3
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= t <= 10^9`
- Each test case will call ping with strictly increasing values of t.
- At most 10^4 calls will be made to ping.

## JavaScript Solution

```javascript
class RecentCounter {
    constructor() {
        this.requests = [];  // Initialize an empty array to store the timestamps of pings
    }

    ping(t) {
        this.requests.push(t);  // Add the current ping time to the array
        // Remove timestamps from the beginning of the array that are outside the 3000 ms window
        while (this.requests[0] < t - 3000) {
            this.requests.shift();
        }
        return this.requests.length;  // Return the number of recent requests
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
We use an array requests to track the timestamps of each ping.
For each ping, we add the timestamp to the end of the array.
We then clean up the array by removing timestamps that are no longer within the last 3000 milliseconds from the start of the array.
The length of the array after the cleanup gives the count of recent requests.


### Notes to Remember
Using an array and cleaning it up regularly ensures that the space complexity does not grow unnecessarily and remains manageable.
This solution ensures that we only keep relevant data in memory and efficiently handle the sliding time window requirement.
Understanding and implementing a queue-like behavior using an array's shift operation allows for easy management of the timestamps.
