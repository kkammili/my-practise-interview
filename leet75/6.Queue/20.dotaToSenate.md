# 649. Dota2 Senate

## Problem Statement
In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire. The Dota2 senate consists of senators from these two parties, who vote on changes to the game through a round-based procedure. Each senator can either ban another senator, causing them to lose voting rights, or announce a victory if all remaining senators are from their party.

Given a string `senate` where 'R' represents a Radiant senator and 'D' represents a Dire senator, predict which party will ultimately win the power to announce the victory.

### Examples

- **Example 1:**
  - **Input:** `senate = "RD"`
  - **Output:** "Radiant"
  - **Explanation:** The first Radiant senator bans the Dire senator, leaving only themselves to vote in the next round.

- **Example 2:**
  - **Input:** `senate = "RDD"`
  - **Output:** "Dire"
  - **Explanation:** The first Radiant senator bans the next Dire senator, but the last senator (Dire) then bans the Radiant senator, securing the victory for Dire in the next round.

## Constraints
- `1 <= senate.length <= 10^4`
- `senate[i]` is either 'R' or 'D'.

## JavaScript Solution
```javascript
function predictPartyVictory(senate) {
    let radiant = [], dire = [];
    
    // Initialize queues for both parties
    for (let i = 0; i < senate.length; i++) {
        if (senate[i] === 'R') radiant.push(i);
        else dire.push(i);
    }
    
    while (radiant.length && dire.length) {
        // Always remove the senator with the earliest position
        if (radiant[0] < dire[0]) {
            // Radiant acts first, Dire senator gets banned
            dire.shift();
            // Push the Radiant senator to the end of the list for the next round
            radiant.push(radiant.shift() + senate.length);
        } else {
            // Dire acts first, Radiant senator gets banned
            radiant.shift();
            // Push the Dire senator to the end of the list for the next round
            dire.push(dire.shift() + senate.length);
        }
    }
    
    // Determine the winner based on which queue is not empty
    return radiant.length ? "Radiant" : "Dire";
}
```

### Explanation
Two queues (radiant and dire) are used to track the indices of senators from each party.
Senators take turns based on their order in the senate string. The senator with the lower index acts first in each pair.
The losing senator is removed from their queue, and the acting senator is re-queued at the end with an incremented index to simulate continuous rounds.
The process repeats until one party runs out of senators, determining the victor.

### Notes to Remember
Use queues to manage the order and continuation of senators efficiently.
Senators are re-queued by adding the length of the senate to simulate their reappearance in subsequent rounds.
This solution runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of senators, as each senator is processed once per round.
