# Problem: Reverse Vowels of a String

## Description

Given a string `s`, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return the modified string. The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

### Examples

1. **Input:** `s = "hello"`  
   **Output:** `"holle"`  
   **Explanation:** The vowels "e" and "o" are reversed.

2. **Input:** `s = "leetcode"`  
   **Output:** `"leotcede"`  
   **Explanation:** The vowels "e", "e", "o", and "e" are reversed to "e", "o", "e", "e".

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5`
- `s` consist of printable ASCII characters.

## Solution in JavaScript

```javascript
function reverseVowels(s) {
    const vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', "A", "E", "I", "O", "U"];
    let hMap = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (vowels.includes(s[i])) {
            hMap[i.toString()] = s[i];
        }
    }

    // Reverse values
    let og = s.split("");
    const vowKeys = Object.keys(hMap);
    const revVow = Object.values(hMap).reverse();
    revVow.forEach((vow, ind) => {
        og.splice(vowKeys[ind], 1, vow);
    });
    return og.join("");
}
```
### Explanation
This solution uses a hash map (hMap) to track the indices and characters of all vowels in the string s. It:

Iterates over the string and stores the index and character in hMap if the character is a vowel.
Splits the original string s into an array og.
Reverses the collected vowels and replaces them in the original positions using the stored indices.
This approach allows the efficient reversal of vowels without affecting other characters in the string.

### Notes
Efficiency: The use of a hash map to store indices and vowels ensures that each vowel's position is easily accessible. This is important given the potential string length (up to 300,000 characters).
Complexity: The time complexity of this solution is O(n) since it involves a single traversal of the string to collect vowels and another to replace them. The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case when the string consists mainly of vowels.
