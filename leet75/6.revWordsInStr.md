# Problem 151: Reverse Words in a String

## Description

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space. The function should return a string with the words in reverse order, concatenated by a single space. Importantly, the input string may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The output must not contain leading or trailing spaces and should reduce multiple spaces between words to a single space.

### Examples

1. **Input:** `s = "the sky is blue"`  
   **Output:** `"blue is sky the"`  
   **Explanation:** Words are reversed in order, and spaces are properly managed.

2. **Input:** `s = "  hello world  "`  
   **Output:** `"world hello"`  
   **Explanation:** The reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

3. **Input:** `s = "a good   example"`  
   **Output:** `"example good a"`  
   **Explanation:** Multiple spaces between words are reduced to a single space in the reversed string.

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
- There is at least one word in `s`.

## Solution in JavaScript

```javascript
function reverseWords(s) {
    return s.trim().split(" ").reverse().filter(word => word !== '').join(" ");
}
```

### Explanation
The function reverses the words in a given string by:

Trimming leading and trailing spaces using s.trim().
Splitting the string into words with s.split(" "), where spaces are the delimiters.
Reversing the array of words with .reverse().
Filtering out any empty strings from the array that represent extraneous spaces between words using .filter(word => word !== '').
Joining the words back into a string with .join(" "), using a single space as the delimiter.
This method efficiently handles strings with varying amounts of whitespace, ensuring that the output adheres to the requirement of having a single space between words without leading or trailing spaces.

### Notes
Efficiency: The function is concise and runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input string, due to the need to process each character and potentially modify the structure.
Space Complexity: The space complexity is also O(n), mainly due to the storage needed for the intermediate array of words.
Testing: Test this function with strings containing only spaces, strings without spaces, and strings with mixed-case letters and special characters to ensure robustness.
